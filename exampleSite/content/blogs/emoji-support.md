## Convention!
Introduction :zap:

Los Angeles, the city of dreams and creativity, played host to one of the most fabulous and vibrant events of the year: Drag Con! For two incredible days, we had the privilege of setting up a dazzling booth and showcasing our glitter cosmetics amidst a kaleidoscope of colors and unapologetic self-expression. I recount my experience with my pals Brittany and Laveau Contraire. 

Chapter 1: Preparing for the Sparkle Extravaganza

We knew that our glitter cosmetics were a match made in heaven for the bold and glamorous world of drag. Our booth, adorned with sparkling banners and shimmering displays, was meticulously designed to draw attendees into our glittering universe. And Laveau Contraire dazzled us with vibrant drag looks while at the both making sales with us. 


Chapter 2: The Glittering Stars of Drag Con

At our booth, attendees could find everything they needed to achieve show-stopping looks. From ultra-pigmented eyeshadows to glitter-packed lip glosses, our products became the secret weapons in many queens' arsenals. We even had professional makeup artists on hand to assist attendees in creating their dream looks.

Chapter 3: Show-Stopping Makeovers and Transformations

One of the highlights of our time at Drag Con was witnessing the incredible transformations that took place at our booth. Drag queens and enthusiasts alike trusted us to help them achieve their visions of beauty and artistry. It was a privilege to be a part of their creative process.

Chapter 4: Embracing the Spirit of Drag

As the vibrant energy of Drag Con enveloped us, we were reminded of the power of authenticity and self-acceptance. Drag is not just about makeup and fashion; it's about the courage to be unapologetically oneself. We were inspired by the incredible queens and performers we met, each of them a beacon of confidence and creativity.


Chapter 5: The Grand Finale

As Drag Con Los Angeles drew to a close, we couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for the unforgettable experience. Our glitter cosmetics had found a home among the stars of drag, and we had made lasting memories and connections that would continue to inspire us. And finally we got to shop at all the other booths! the highlights were definitely (Glisten Cosmetics)[https://www.glistencosmetics.com/collections/wet-liners] with their wet liners! and (Kim Chi Chic)[https://kimchichicbeauty.com/] beauty with their fabulous packaging and accesories. I definitely enjoyed the foundation and setting spray from this brand also!!

Conclusion

Our two days at Drag Con Los Angeles were nothing short of magical. It reinforced our belief that makeup is a powerful tool for self-expression and that beauty knows no boundaries. We left with hearts full of inspiration, ready to continue our journey of bringing glitz and glamour to the world. Until the next time, Los Angeles, shine on!
