Introduction :zap:

Los Angeles, the city of dreams and creativity, played host to one of the most fabulous and vibrant events of the year: Drag Con! For two incredible days, we had the privilege of setting up a dazzling booth and showcasing our glitter cosmetics amidst a kaleidoscope of colors, flamboyant fashion, and unapologetic self-expression. Join us as we recount our whirlwind journey at Drag Con Los Angeles.

At our booth, attendees could find everything they needed to achieve show-stopping looks.

As the vibrant energy of Drag Con enveloped us, we were reminded of the power of authenticity and self-acceptance. Drag is not just about makeup and fashion; it's about the courage to be unapologetically oneself. We were inspired by the incredible queens and performers we met, each of them a beacon of confidence and creativity.

Chapter 6: Creating Lasting Connections

Drag Con was not only an opportunity to showcase our products but also a chance to connect with the drag community and fellow entrepreneurs. We exchanged stories, tips, and ideas with those who share our passion for beauty and self-expression.
