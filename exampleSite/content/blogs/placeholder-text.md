4059 
I’m writing from a new zip code. Time zone
I miss home 
won’t go though.
Here’s a post card… from me.
Take of steep breath of humidity 
Touch the Spanish moss on the oak trees 
For me..,breath me
I’m open to love … finally
Trying to retire all the bouts of all my wallowing.. gratuitously in sadness… kneading into the feeling 
needing all the feeling 
New Orleans my love you caress me then you bruise me 
with your moods 
You’re gorgeous but u scare me 
anxiety and blues
Warmth and soul food 
The time is ticking surely… but am I coming back to you?
It’s surely more free 
Any chance to be floating 
Hopping cities 
I want to stop feeling so small
But continue to feel so free
New Orleans my love write back to me…
