As I waded through the the thick brush with heaps of branches and fresh water streams, the anticipation of discovering these elusive was thrilling. Armed with nets and traps, The members of the Wilson Lab group (Robbie and Gabbie) and I carefully examined the rocky crevices and submerged traps where these crayfish typically sought refuge. The process was challenging, as their swift and secretive movements made them formidable opponents to catch. The lush, untamed beauty of the surrounding landscapes and the gentle sound of trickling water served as a reminder of the untamed wonders of nature. Despite the initial difficulties, the beauty of the landscape was worthwhile though some of the Locations were barren in terms of crayfish abundance. My first foray into fieldwork was not only a remarkable adventure but also a profound introduction to the marvels of aquatic ecosystems in this stunning corner of the world. We caught quite a few crayfish at the North Stradbrook sites compared to the other sites. Overall it was a new and enjoyable experience.
